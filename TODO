[todo] Add calculated max for filters
[todo] Screensaver with random flavor text
[todo] Jinteki/Haas-Bioroid special deck URLs
[todo] Rethink itemLayouts in cards-view. I'm thinking that maybe they should be set to default values up front, then modified as time goes on. No more clearing (as you see in performGridLayout).
[todo] Randomized deck generation (draft decks), along with a couple special identity print outs

[todo] Interesting comment:

  On the deck side - one thing that I'm dying for is a collection organizer...
  i want to be able to tell the site what sets I have - and then be able to figure
  out which decks I can build concurrently - ie flag decks as "currently constructed" -
  and then be able to filter / sort your other decks based on how much swapping would
  be necessary to build them.

And related:

  Versions for decks, and changes tab for telling you how to move between versions

[todo] Cost to break bug -- click on opponent, then go next/prev. URL is not correct.
[todo] Have you bought the new datapack yet?
[todo] Don't scroll to top when toggling spoilers
[todo] If I decide to go with public decks, allow searching decks by datapack
[todo] The URL state manager is completely out of line with the logic that decides which
       views should be shown.
[bug] Text colors are different depending on the input control

SIDE PROJECT
  Modernizr for performance characteristics. Maybe built with hooks so you can be constantly
  monitoring the live application.

  Characteristics to test for:
  * Scrolling
  * Image scale

IDEA FOR RESPONSIVE DESIGNS
  It seems like determining responsive breakpoints is often about determining when wrapping occurs, and replacing a
  control with a smaller representation.

  Seems like annotating HTML and generating the breakpoint variables would be an interesting project.

GAME IDEA
  Excitebike for code files
