[todo] Collapsed mode for card groups
[todo] Hotkeys
[todo] Add calculated max for filters
[todo] Make it clear that moving back to the general filter will remove filters (or not -- color change made this better)
[todo] Screensaver with random flavor text
[todo] Jinteki/Haas-Bioroid special deck URLs
[todo] Excluded general controls should explain through a tooltip why they're disabled
[todo] Rethink itemLayouts in cards-view. I'm thinking that maybe they should be set to default values up front, then modified as time goes on. No more clearing (as you see in performGridLayout).
[todo] Rename "filter" to "queryArgs" across the board
[todo] Randomized deck generation (draft decks), along with a couple special identity print outs
[todo] Scrolling on the card view
[fix]  Work out a better way of counting subs -- Check out sensei as an example
[todo] Write this (http://www.reddit.com/r/Netrunner/comments/1s5gu4/i_made_a_spreadsheet_of_probabilities_to_have_x/cdu7hpf)
[todo] Full screen mode for mobile
[todo] Versions for decks, and changes tab for telling you how to move between versions
[todo] Filter down the subtype list to the currently selected group (maybe)
[todo] .nav-tabs conflicts with something in bootstrap
[todo] One stop search
[todo] Consider adding all applicable attributes to groupings, depending on active group
[todo] Off the Grid, in card search
[todo] Sort by card number
[todo] Hosted power counters on ICE -- Any ideas here? (Victor 2.0)
[todo] Make clearing searches more obvious
[idea] Efficiency improvement:
  Cards only have to be sorted once up front, then grouping them will always yield sorted results.
  Single pass group by.
[todo] Cycle icons
[todo] Card groups
[todo] Interesting comment:

  On the deck side - one thing that I'm dying for is a collection organizer...
  i want to be able to tell the site what sets I have - and then be able to figure
  out which decks I can build concurrently - ie flag decks as "currently constructed" -
  and then be able to filter / sort your other decks based on how much swapping would
  be necessary to build them.

[todo] Cost to break bug -- click on opponent, then go next/prev. URL is not correct.
[todo] Have you bought the new datapack yet?
[todo] Don't scroll to top when toggling spoilers
[todo] If I decide to go with public decks, allow searching decks by datapack
[bug] Filter to set and subtype, jump to a card, go back, subtype is no longer selected
[bug] Text colors are different depending on the input control

SIDE PROJECT
  Modernizr for performance characteristics. Maybe built with hooks so you can be constantly
  monitoring the live application.

  Characteristics to test for:
  * Scrolling
  * Image scale

IDEA FOR RESPONSIVE DESIGNS
  It seems like determining responsive breakpoints is often about determining when wrapping occurs, and replacing a
  control with a smaller representation.

  Seems like annotating HTML and generating the breakpoint variables would be an interesting project.

GAME IDEA
  Excitebike for code files
